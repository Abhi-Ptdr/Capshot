# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-09)

Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1 scaffold uses current package names: `motion@14` (not `framer-motion`), `react-router@8` (not `react-router-dom`), `tailwindcss@4.3` with CSS-first `@theme` (no JS config)
- Mobile-perf items that sound like polish (`LazyMotion`, `100dvh`, FOUC inline script, `vite-imagetools`) are Phase 1 correctness conditions, not Phase 4+ polish
- Meta Pixel + Conversions API install in Phase 1 (not Phase 6) to build retargeting pools during the waitlist period
- Instagram/Facebook WKWebView detect-and-nudge banner is a Phase 1 scaffold (95% of traffic arrives through those webviews)
- Phase 6 is a near-zero-refactor swap: 3 files edited (`cta.ts`, `flavors.ts`, `features.ts`), 2 added (`bundles.ts`, `og/bundles.jpg`), 1 section un-gated (`Bundles.tsx`)
