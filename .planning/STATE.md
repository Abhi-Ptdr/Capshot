# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-09)

**Core value:** Convert a mobile ad-driven visitor into an engaged pre-launch waitlist signup — and later, a buyer — through premium, scroll-driven brand storytelling that makes the "twist, shake, boom" moment feel inevitable to try.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation + Hero + Conversion Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation + Hero + Conversion Infrastructure)
Plan: 1 of 3 complete in current phase
Status: Awaiting human-verify checkpoint before Plan 02 (conversion scaffold + real Hero)
Last activity: 2026-10-09 -- Phase 01 Plan 01 Walking Skeleton complete (9/9 e2e GREEN)

Progress: [▓░░░░░░░░░] 5%

## Performance Metrics

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 (Foundation) | 1 / 3 | ~50 min | ~50 min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1 scaffold uses current package names: `motion@14` (not `framer-motion`), `react-router@8` (not `react-router-dom`), `tailwindcss@4.3` with CSS-first `@theme` (no JS config)
- Mobile-perf items that sound like polish (`LazyMotion`, `100dvh`, FOUC inline script, `vite-imagetools`) are Phase 1 correctness conditions, not Phase 4+ polish
- Meta Pixel + Conversions API install in Phase 1 (not Phase 6) to build retargeting pools during the waitlist period
- Instagram/Facebook WKWebView detect-and-nudge banner is a Phase 1 scaffold (95% of traffic arrives through those webviews)
- Phase 6 is a near-zero-refactor swap: 3 files edited (`cta.ts`, `flavors.ts`, `features.ts`), 2 added (`bundles.ts`, `og/bundles.jpg`), 1 section un-gated (`Bundles.tsx`)
- **Plan 01 execution (2026-10-09):** `.npmrc legacy-peer-deps=true` required to bypass @typescript-eslint 8.71's stale TS <6.1.0 peer-range cap; keeps CLAUDE.md pinned versions intact
- **Plan 01 execution:** Vite preview `spa-fallback-with-404` plugin added to mirror `vercel.json` behavior locally so Playwright/curl verify true HTTP 404 (CONTEXT D-17) during development
- **Plan 01 execution:** Playwright drives system Google Chrome via `channel: 'chrome'` + `--proxy-bypass-list=<-loopback>` because the exec host's HTTP_PROXY env and the bundled-Chromium CDN block prevented the default `npx playwright install chromium` path from working
- **Plan 01 execution:** `npm run lint` is a no-op in Phase 1 pending @typescript-eslint TS 7 support (upstream issue typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint#10940) and eslint-plugin-react ESLint 10 compatibility; `tsc --noEmit` in `npm run build` catches type errors
- **Plan 01 execution:** TS 7 config adjustments: `baseUrl` removed (TS 7 removal), composite project reference dropped (noEmit incompatibility), `src/env.d.ts` added for CSS side-effect import

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- **GATE-FSSAI** (client deliverable): 14-digit FSSAI license number required before Phase 6 Razorpay food-category KYC
- **GATE-INVENTORY** (client deliverable): Warehoused inventory + verified Shiprocket pickup address required before Phase 6
- **GATE-BUDGET** (client deliverable): ~₹2,000/mo Shopify Basic approval required before Phase 6
- **GATE-NUTRITION** (client deliverable): Per-flavor nutrition + caffeine content required for Phase 5 Trust section's permanent production state and Phase 6 PDPs
- Founder photo + 2–3 line bio pending for Phase 5 About page (placeholder acceptable)
- Final product shots for 8 of 16 flavors pending (placeholders acceptable through Phase 2)
- **ESLint plugin re-enablement**: `@typescript-eslint` and `eslint-plugin-react` plugin wiring deferred until upstreams ship TS 7 + ESLint 10 compatibility (tracked by typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint#10940). One-install migration when ready.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| tooling  | ESLint plugin wiring (@typescript-eslint, eslint-plugin-react) | Pending upstream TS 7 + ESLint 10 compat | Plan 01 (2026-10-09) |
